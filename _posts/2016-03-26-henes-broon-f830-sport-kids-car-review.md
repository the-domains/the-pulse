Do you want to treat your kids every now and then? The Broom F830 Sport is a kids car designed for older toddlers to six year olds. However, what makes it different from other kids' cars you'll find at toy stores is how it combines advanced technology with style. You can order the car in red, black, or white. The F830 will come disassembled, but once you put it together, you'll appreciate its sport car-like design. More importantly, your child will have a ton of fun as they cruise around the neighborhood!

When your child walks up to the Broon F830, they'll actually be able to pull the door and step inside. Like a real car, this one has working doors, rear and front lights, turn signals, as well as accessible hood and trunk. A 12 V motor powers the F830, and with coil spring suspensions and independent gas shock absorbers, your child's ride will be smooth whether over cement, grass, or other terrains. For your child's safety, they'll sit in an ergonomically designed bucket chair with 4-point seat belt, so they'll be safe and comfortable. When your child gets in and drive, the rechargeable vehicle can go up to 6 miles per hour.

Depending on their comfort level with car speed and maneuverability, your child can choose three levels of control over their car: from comfort, to normal, to dynamic. What's more, the vehicle comes with a Bluetooth remote control, so you can control it from a distance if your child wants to ride it but hasn't yet fully grasped steering---an added level of safety. The F830 also comes with a detachable 7-inch Android enabled tablet. When attached to the car dashboard, it displays speed, electronics temperature, distance from destination, and even diagnostics tests--this is a plus as your children can use having fun as a learning experience.

The tablet is Wi-Fi enabled so your child can use it on or off the car to download and play games from the Google Play Store, as well as watch videos or play music. Overall, the Henes Broon F830 car is a high-end kid's vehicle that is a notch above the rest when it comes to looks and technology.
