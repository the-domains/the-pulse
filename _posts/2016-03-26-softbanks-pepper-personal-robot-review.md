Personal robots are starting show up in our homes. But if you think it's going to mix a drink, cook a meal, or do laundry, think again. In fact, today's personal robots can help manage everyday work and entertain but In in spite of their sophistication, most home robots just talk, move around, and pick up light things.

Meet Pepper---a human-shaped robot capable of being kind, endearing and surprising. Softbank has designed Pepper to be a genuine day-to-day companion, whose number one quality is his ability to perceive emotions. Pepper is a next gen humanoid robot capable of recognizing human emotions and adapting its behavior. Pleasant and likable, Pepper communicates in the most natural and intuitive way through body movements and voice.

As soon as you turn it on, Pepper starts to look, listen and it's b?e active within the environment. It interacts with you, learns more about your tastes, habits and who you are. It can recognize your face, speak, hear and move around autonomously. Based on your voice, face expression, body movements and the words you use, Pepper will interpret your emotions and offer appropriate content. It will also respond to your mood by expressing itself through the color of his eyes, his tablet or his tone of voice.

Pepper can dance, play, and even chat in another language.
Most of this these functions are already built in. But if you want to do more, learning its programming language is a must. To facilitate interaction with their robots, Softbank has developed its own operating system and tools. These tools enable more sophisticated behaviors to be created, provide access to data acquired by its sensors, and allow Pepper to be piloted. You can also choose to purchase ready-made apps.

In the not so distant future personal robots will help manage everyday work. The next step is linking all existing technology in your home and to be controlled by a robot. Personal robots like Pepper will ultimately do a myriad of useful things at home. In the next ten years or so, robots could become as common as any other appliance.

Good: 

_Fun for the whole family. Friendly companion. Next-generation personal robotics. IBM is involved in its artificial intelligence development. Shares data collected with other Pepper robots to increase its capabilities._

Not so good:

_Builds up unrealistic expectations of home robotics. A new programming language to learn. More functionality requires buying programs from manufacturer. Not available in the US yet._
